from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')  # Home page
def home():
    return "Hello! I am Sonali"

@app.route('/about')  # About page
def about():
    return "I am an engineering student interested in backend development and web technologies. I enjoy learning new tools, building projects, and improving my problem-solving skills through hands-on experience."

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

# =============================================================================
# EXERCISES - Try these after running the basic app:
# =============================================================================
#
# Exercise 1.1: Change the return message
#   - Modify the return statement to say "Hello [Your Name]!"
#   - Save the file and refresh your browser (server auto-reloads!)
#
# Exercise 1.2: Return HTML instead of plain text
#   - Change the return to: return "<h1>Hello Flask!</h1><p>This is HTML</p>"
#   - Notice how the browser renders it as formatted HTML
#
# Exercise 1.3: Add a second route
#   - Add another function with @app.route('/about')
#   - Return something like "This is the about page"
#   - Visit http://localhost:5000/about in your browser
